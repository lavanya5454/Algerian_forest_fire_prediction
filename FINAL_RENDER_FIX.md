# FINAL FIX - Your Render Deployment

## The Problem
Render was using Python 3.13.4 which is too new for your packages.

## The Solution - Add These Files

### 1. `runtime.txt` (forces Python 3.9.18)
```
python-3.9.18
```

### 2. `requirements.txt` (flexible versions)
```
Flask>=2.0.0,<3.0.0
pandas>=1.3.0,<2.1.0
numpy>=1.21.0,<1.25.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0,<1.4.0
gunicorn>=20.0.0
Werkzeug>=2.0.0,<3.0.0
```

### 3. Keep your updated `main.py`
### 4. Keep your `render.yaml`

## Upload to GitHub:
1. `runtime.txt` (new file)
2. `final_requirements.txt` → rename to `requirements.txt`
3. Your updated `main.py`
4. Your `render.yaml`
5. All your other 18 project files

## This Will Work!
✅ Forces Python 3.9.18 (compatible)
✅ Flexible package versions (won't break)
✅ Pre-built wheels available
✅ No compilation needed

Your forest fire prediction app will deploy successfully!
